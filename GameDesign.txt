Each time you move rooms you lose 10% of your oxygen.
You need to find the escape pod before your oxygen runs out or you are destroyed by a monster.

When you go into a room where there is a monster you have to fight the monster.
You fight the monster by firing your gun.
Each time you fire your gun you randomly generate a number, and the monster also generates a random number.
If your number is higher than the monster you take 10% off its suit integrity.
